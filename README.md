Cloud Explorer is being ported to Haxe to make it available in HTML5, Flash, native iOS and native Android.

As soon as the HTML5 target becomes stable, this branch will become the master branch of the repository.

The Cloud Explorer API will remained unchanged and will still stick to the Ink File Picker API : https://developers.inkfilepicker.com/docs/web/
